#My process

**Step one - decide what to improve**
I believed there are four things I can do to improve the visualization:
* 1. Add a title
* 2. Tidy up the legends
* 3. Clarify what is meant by "food away from home"
* 4. Find a more intuitive way to visualize the data (different chart format)

**Step two - research and wireframe my ideas**

Legend and title: they are easy to work with, so I didn't spend much time on them in this step.

Definition: it took some research to find what "food away from home" is meant. The link on FRED website took me to many more links, none of which offered an explicit explanation. Finally, I was able to find the original presentation on this topic from a [pdf file](https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2020/food-away-from-home/pdf/food-away-from-home.pdf) on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Visualization: it took me two steps. First, since FRED offers unbiased data that intentionally does not highlight anything, I had to decide what I would want to highlight from studying the data and whether it would support an interesting article. I decided to focus on the biggest contributors (by age groups) for supporting the food service industry. After that, I moved on to step two, which was so sketch some possible ways to visualize the data (pictures below)

**Step three - testing my ideas**

I ran my idea and sketches by two friends, M and J. M is a student at Tepper and J is a French teacher. 

Bar charts: Both of them immediately turned down the bar charts. M thought it is so overused in presentations that whenever she sees them, she relates them to "lame concepts and ancient ideas". P did not like the bar charts but thought the reduced version of it could work by excluding some age groups that I didn't want to highlight anyway.

Stacked bar chart: M liked the idea. She thought it looks much more neat and modern, and associated them with more modern looking reports from consulting agencies. P thought the concept was good but doubted if it allows the audience to make comparisons easily. He thought essentially it shared the same weaknesses with the original chart. I realized that was actually a very valid point. 

Line chart: Having done this week's exercises, which encouraged us to explore different formats other than line charts, I really wanted to avoid it! However, in the end, both my two friends and I all agreed it made the most sense, was the easiest for the audience to process and looked the cleanest.
 
#My redesign 

My title clarifies my focus on top spenders, though there are really multiple pieces of interesting information..so I used the subtitle to draw some attention to a secondary "fun fact". Finally, I used the small text to make sure my audience is able to understand exactly what the graph intends to convey. I am aware that this visual has quite some text, but after some consideration, I decided it's best to still keep it the way it is.
