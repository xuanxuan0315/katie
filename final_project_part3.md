My final project was different in several ways from how I had envisioned it during the planning stages. Several changes include:

## Intended audience

I broadened my intended audience from mostly younger female audience to any curious male or female roughly between the 20 - 50. 

When I finished interviewing three friends for their feedback in Part II of the project, I had a somewhat pessimistic impression that the nature of my chosen topic meant I couldn’t expect most male audience to be interested in the story. 

However, as I was actually building out the presentation, I shared the WIP with some people and asked them if they liked the look of it. In general, people seemed to find it much more interesting once they saw images and colors – including my male audience. I realized that just verbally conveying my ideas and walking people through some black-and-white wireframes just weren’t very enticing. Once they saw the actual look of the project, especially some of the vintage posters I had found, they were naturally more interested.

That gave me confidence to make efforts to broaden my intended audience. To make that happen, I redesigned the focus of my story and swapped some of the data that I had collected for new types of data that I thought would speak to the story more.

## Focus of the story

Originally, my plan was to make the story more quantitative, using macroeconomic and marketing data to analyze the potential causes of fluctuations in lipstick sale. After realizing that my audience was more interested in the history and psychology associated with lipsticks, I decided to employ more data from psychology surveys and dig more into the history of lipstick usage around the world.

## Data and data visualization   

The majority of my data, as a result, came from many psychology papers and some of them go back 70 – 100 years. Some were summarized in tables on scanned pdfs and I had to manually recreate them in Excel before exporting to platforms like Flourish.

The visualization part was fun. I followed the suggestions from my interviewees and tried to make them more entertaining and simpler to look at. For example, I used lipstick icons to do a usage frequency chart and a dollar-bill with wings to show how waitresses who did not wear lipsticks earned a third less in tips compared with those who wore red lipstick. 

The trade-off was that I didn’t get to take advantage of popular, free visualization software and had to create those graphs in illustrator and Power Point. I had a lot of fun in the process though.
