The three different visualization methods highlight different elements. The bar chart provides a clear comparison between countries during a single year. The reader can immediately identify the two countries on either side. The grid line chart gives an equal overview of each country's debt-to-GDP ratio over time. It takes time to develop an idea as to which countries have what charactersitics, and since the lines are not shown on one single chart, it is very hard to compare the differences. The third method, which shows all the countries on the same chart, allows the reader to compare the differences more easily. However, since we are comparing many countries, the this method can only be informative if we have a narrower focus. Therefore, in my case, I chose to highlight the PIIGS to demonstrate my point. Doing so allows me to only focus on five lines, which are not too overwhemling for the reader to process. These five lines also share similar trends, so I can write an informative title.
