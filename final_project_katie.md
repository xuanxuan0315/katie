# Outline

Since the pandemic and the lockdown, sweatpants, unwashed face and messy hair seem to have become a new way of life for many of us working from home. As a result, some industry experts predicted that one of the hardest-hit sectors would be cosmetics. Within cosmetics, lipsticks would be the biggest victim for obvious reasons. However, data shows it hasn’t been the case. My story aims to explain why it isn’t what we thought. 


# Structure

**Start - Invite audience to participate:**
All the lipstick lovers, before the pandemic turned our lives upside down, do you remember how often you used lipsticks? Once a day? Twice a week?

Mmhmm, you are not alone. We all love them. (lipstick usage frequency chart, 2011-2019)

**Encourage audience to make a guess and stay curious:**  
How about after COVID hit? when was the last time you slapped some color on your lips? Days? Weeks?

**Surprise them with results they probably weren’t expecting:**
/I know, who would bother buying lipstick when everyone is working from home and wearing masks? – Can you imagine what other sane lipstick wearer said?  (lipstick usage frequency chart, 2020)

Did that surprise you? Yep, we are still using lipsticks, even last year! 

In fact, we are not just using the old lipsticks for the sake of not letting them go to waste – we are still buying, too!  (lipstick sales, 2020)

**Encourage them to keep on reading to find out:**
/Why is that?! Well, there may be a couple reasons.

From a behavioral economics perspective: “the Lipstick index”
*	What it is
*	How it worked before
*	How it applies to the present

From a practicality’s perspective:
*	Many of us still want it for Zoom calls

From a cultural and psychological perspective: 
*	History of lipsticks
*	Lipstick often carries a personality statement: optimism, courage and defiance 

**End – Leave audience with some cheerful thoughts by ending on lighthearted note**

# Medium
I will use Shorthand to tell my story. As my topic (lipsticks) is colorful in nature, I plan to use incporate some strong visual elements and highlight color and aesthetics with either the Background Scrollmation format or the Reveal format in Shorthand.
