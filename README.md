# About me
Hi! My name is Katie (she/her) and welcome to my page! 

I'm a second-year Masters student at CMU studying MBA and Public Policy. I am originally from Beijing, China.

My hobbies include watching horror movies, spending time with animals and travelling (among other stuff). Since COVID I have become a succulent enthusiast and acquired a few random skills such as patching up old and weirdly shaped stuffed animals. If you would like a little succulent plant (for free), let me know!

## What I hope to learn

In my previous job, I rarely worked with quantitative data but often had to write lenghty reports or make presentations. I enjoyed the process of building an argument and expressing ideas, but regretted that I was only able to leverage and present data in simple and often boring ways. I hope to learn the thought/design process that goes behind data visialization as well as the different ways to present data in creative, effective and appealing styles.
