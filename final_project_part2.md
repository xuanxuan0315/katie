## Persona
I generated three personas that I imagine would likely be my audience. Overall, I expect the majority of my audience to be females between 20-50 with bachelor’s or master’s degrees. I expect most of them, if they are not students, to have backgrounds in sales, retail, marketing, communication or general management/project management. I also expect a small number of people who don’t relate much to the beauty industry to be interested in the story just because they are a little curious. These people would be mostly males, between 20 – 45, who are also college educated (or above) and could be from any sector but in particular sectors that are exposed to diverse information, such as consulting and marketing.

Based on these personas, I selected three interviewees that best match them

## Interview

Key concerns I wanted answers for:

**Priority**:
* Overall positioning: where do they see a story like this fit? 
* Audience inclusion: what would my story more interesting to someone who doesn’t relate to the beauty industry? 

**Secondary**:
* Logic/Flow: does the logic make sense?
* Storytelling (appeal): is the beginning of the story a good attention-grabber?
* Data quantity/usage: too much, too little?
* Call for action (audience expectation): reasonable? Do they expect something more meaningful?

**Detailed questions**:
* Re positioning: where would you expect to read about something like this? Where would you see it best fits?

* Re inclusion: what do you expect out of the story given you are not interested in beauty products or don’t relate to them? What would encourage you to still read it?

* Logic: did the flow of the story make sense to you? Would you change the order of any part of the story? What do you think I can add or take away?

* Re storytelling: did the start (title, focus) of the story get your attention? 

* Re data quantity/usage: too much? Too little? Unevenly distributed?

* Re call for action: did the end surprise you? Did you expect the story to end on a more meaningful note? What thoughts did you have about the story before you saw the end?

## Decisions I made based on feedback:

* Position: it’s a story one expects to see as a page-long piece in beauty or lifestyle magazines like Vogue, which brings a bit of education and nerdiness for a fun change; It could also be short read in The Economist, after the mainstream politics and economics sections, as a refreshing “fun fact” that is easy to read. It is not a controversial topic or one of life-or-death importance, but a light-hearted read over coffee. 

* Data: I decided to stop trying to present data more evenly throughout the story for the sake of making the distribution look more uniform. Some of the data I tried to incorporate into the history of lipsticks and its cultural connotation apparently were a bit detached from the main points of the story and were unnecessary.  Trying to fill in more data also sours the light-heartedness and the fun factor, and instead turn it into a half-baked industry analysis that bore its audience.

* Visual style: Audience expects good aesthetics for a story like this and I will try to make extra effort on it. Color was a main focus among my interviewees. Two of them recommended bright, cartoonish infographics-styled layouts. All of them suggested that I steer clear from the traditional bar charts and pie charts as they would immediately feel it’s something “serious” or “work related”. One of my interviewees said she would avoid using images of real faces, especially models’ or celebrities’, or images of glorious high fashion since doing so would make the story look “tacky”. So, I think I will try to use bright colors and abstract, cartoonish images instead.

* Call for action: I decided to end the story by summarizing the answer to the question I post in the story (why are people still wearing lipsticks during COVID?) without calling for specific actions or trying to evoke emotions. My concern had always been that my story did not have a strong call for action. My interviewees overall took the story as a piece of “fun fact” did not expect to see an explicit call for action since they thought there was nothing to call for. My idea of ending the story on encouraging people to stay optimistic during COVID was not very well received, as they thought the message was either far-fetched, a bit cliché at this point, or unnecessary. 

## Visualization ideas:
While some of the economy-related data will end up as line charts or bar charts, I will try to make the rest of the data look more interesting, for example:

* Data demostrating the drop in luxury goods sale in time of crisis:
